## Part 3

In this part we are going to explore (mainly using notebooks) Single-cell morphometry, quantitative analyses of cell groups, and analyses involving databases and brain atlases. Due to lack of time we will not cover Persistence Holomogy (and persistence landscape) analyses and Cx3D integration.
