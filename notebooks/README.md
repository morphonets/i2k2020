# SNT Notebooks

This collection of notebooks demonstrates how to access the [SNT][] [API][] from a
Python environment. It is a mirror of  SNT's notebooks directory



## Requirements

The core requirement are [pyimagej] and [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) (which we'll assume you have already done).

> IMPORTANT!
>
> As of 2020.11.27, with the most recent Fiji, attempting to initialize pyimagej with a local Fiji installation may result in the following error:  
>
> ```
> JavaException: JVM exception occurred: Invalid service: sc.fiji.filamentdetector.gui.GUIStatusService
> ```
>
> the  [workaround](https://forum.image.sc/t/fiji-fails-to-launch-after-update/44582) is to locate the jars folder inside the Fiji.app directory and rename the `FilamentDetector-1.0.0.jar` file to  `FilamentDetector-1.0.0.jar-disabled`



### To install pyimagej:

1. Install [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). See e.g., [here][pyimagej] for details.
   
2. Activate the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel and set it default:

  ```bash
  conda config --add channels conda-forge
  conda config --set channel_priority strict
  ```

3. Install [pyimagej] into a new conda environment named `pyimagej`:

  ```bash
  conda create -n pyimagej pyimagej openjdk
  ```

  At this point, it is convenient to make the new `pyimagej` environment available
  in the graphical notebook interface:

  ```bash
  conda install -n pyimagej ipykernel
  conda activate pyimagej
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pyimagej
  ```

  Now, when you now start jupyter, it will show `pyimagej` in the list of
  registered kernels. Selecting it, makes all the packages installed in the
  `pyimagej` environment available.


## Setup
Before running the notebooks, there are three more things to take care of:

1. Make sure your Fij installation is up-to-date and subscribed to the
   [NeuroAnatomy update site](https://imagej.net/SNT#install)

2. Make the notebooks aware of your local `Fij.app` location. You can do so by
   editing [ijfinder.py](./ijfinder.py):

  ```python
  local_fiji_dir = r'/path/to/your/local/Fiji.app'
  ```
  (replacing `/path/to/your/local/Fiji.app` with the actual path to `Fiji.app`).
  If you skip this step, you will be prompted to choose the Fiji directory
  every-time `ijfinder.py` is called.

3. If you haven't done so, install the packages required to run these notebooks
   in the `pyimagej` environment. The majority requires popular packages
   available from the default anaconda channel, e.g.:

  ```bash
  conda activate pyimagej
  conda install jupyterlab matplotlib pandas seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

  However, some notebooks require other packages only in `conda-forge`:

  ```bash
  conda activate pyimagej
  conda install trimesh
  ```
  Some functionality may require [blender](https://www.blender.org/download/).


## Running
Activate the `pyimagej` environment (if you have not registered it in `ipykernel`)
and start jupyter from the _notebooks_ [directory](./):

```bash
cd /path/to/notebooks/directory
conda activate pyimagej
jupyter notebook
```

(replacing `/path/to/notebooks/directory` with the path to the actual directory
where you unzipped the _notebooks_ directory). If you prefer JupyterLab, replace
`jupyter notebook` with `jupyter lab`. If not present, you may need to install
jupyter on the `pyimagej` environment:

```bash
conda activate pyimagej
conda install jupyterlab
```


## Troubleshooting

### Installation
There have been confusing reports of errors related to missing `libjvm.so` files
with java 8 (on Ubuntu 19.10). Adopting a newer openjdk (and pyjnius) seems to
fix this:

```bash
conda activate pyimagej
conda install openjdk=11
```

Note that installing packages from multiple channels may lead to conflicts.
Packages served by e.g., `conda-forge` and the regular `defaults` channel may
not be 1000% compatible. You can impose a preference for `conda-forge` by having
it listed on the top of your `.condarc` file, and by specifying the priority
policy, so that packages install from `conda-forge` by default:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Otherwise, you can also use the `-c` flag to specify a package from a specific
channel. E.g., You can install matplotlib from the `defaults` channel:

```bash
conda activate pyimagej
conda install -c defaults matplotlib
```
or from `conda-forge`:

```bash
conda activate pyimagej
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```

#### Converting from Java
Java objects returned by SNT may need to be converted to the equivalent Python
representation. This is achieved by calling pyimagej's `ij.py.from_java()`. For
more details have a look at the [SNT](./1_overview.ipynb) and
[pyimagej][pyimagej_intro] introductory notebooks.


### Known Issues

Collecting frames from [Viewer3D](https://morphonets.github.io/SNT/index.html?sc/fiji/snt/viewer/Viewer3D.html)
may not work on multiple displays when initializing Viewer3D from a secondary
display (at least on Ubuntu 19.10). The current workaround is to run the notebook
on the primary display.
