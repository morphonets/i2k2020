## Part 1

In this sections students will be guided through the the multiple ways neuronal processes are reconstructed in SNT.  Exercises will focus on scripting the 'tracing' process.



#### Key Concepts

Path, Bidirectional A* search, Hessian analysis, Secondary image, Path fitting, Path filling



### Exercises

1. **Scripted tracing demo:**
   1. Load the *ddaC neuron* sample image: File> Choose Tracing Image> From Demo...  (*Drosophila ddaC neuron (2D)*)
   2. Disable A* search (Main pane, auto-tracing widget)
   3. Make a straight-line path by clicking on the soma and a distal dendrite
   4. Drag and drop [scripted-tracingResources.groovy](./scripted-tracing.groovy) into the main ImageJ window  (or use File>New>Script... in Fiji, or simply press <kbd>[</kbd>) 

2. [intensity_profile.py](./intensity_profile.py)
3. [time_profile.py](./time_profile.py)

4. Scripted tracing: In the Script Editor' look for the following script in *Templates> Neuroanatomy> Tracings* ([source](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/src/main/resources/script_templates/Neuroanatomy/Tracing)):
   1. Scripted_Tracing_Demo_(Interactive).py
   2. Scripted_Tracing_Demo.py



### Homework

In this session we scripted an A* search from a manual path. Would would you modify the script to use a ROI (e.g., a line or a set of points) instead?
