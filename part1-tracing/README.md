## Outline
In this sections students will be guided through the the multiple ways neuronal processes are reconstructed in SNT.  Exercises will focus on scripting the 'tracing' process

#### Key Concepts

Path, Bidirectional A* search, Hessian analysis, Secondary Image, Path Fitting, Path Filling

### Overview

1. Walk-trough of GUI-base functionality:
   1. Usage Tips (drag & drop functionality, shortcuts, auto-registering scripts, Reset)
2. Pitfalls
   
2. Assisted-tracing:
   1. Controls (Tracing and Editing)
   2. Hessian-base analysis 
   3. Tracing on Secondary Images
3. Proof-editing:
   1. Path Manager (controls, tags, morphometric filtering, etc.)
   2. Editing controls
   3. Path fitting
4. ImageJ interoperability:
   1. Access Paths as ROIs, intensity profiles, etc.
5. Automated tracing
   1. Obtaining reconstructions directly from images
   2. Proof-editing the result
